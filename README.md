# ATM-Application
Built a feature-rich ATM simulator in Java using core OOP concepts including interfaces, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism (without collections). Designed multiple classes (Account, User, Bank, ATM) and an ATMOperations interface to handle balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, PIN change/reset and multi-user login/logout.
